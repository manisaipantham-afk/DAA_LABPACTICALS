## 1. Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Example

```text
Unsorted Array: 64 34 25 12 22 11 90
Sorted Array:   11 12 22 25 34 64 90
```

### Complexity

| Case         | Time Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n)            |
| Average Case | O(n²)           |
| Worst Case   | O(n²)           |

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## 2. Selection Sort

Selection Sort finds the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning.

### Example

```text
Unsorted Array: 64 25 12 22 11
Sorted Array:   11 12 22 25 64
```

### Complexity

| Case         | Time Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n²)           |
| Average Case | O(n²)           |
| Worst Case   | O(n²)           |

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## 3. Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

### Example

```text
Unsorted Array: 64 25 12 22 11
Sorted Array:   11 12 22 25 64
```

### Complexity

| Case         | Time Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n)            |
| Average Case | O(n²)           |
| Worst Case   | O(n²)           |

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## 4. Quick Sort

Quick Sort uses a **pivot** element to divide the array into smaller and larger elements. It then recursively sorts the two partitions.

### Example

```text
Unsorted Array: 64 25 12 22 11
Sorted Array:   11 12 22 25 64
```

### Complexity

| Case         | Time Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n log n)      |
| Average Case | O(n log n)      |
| Worst Case   | O(n²)           |

**Space Complexity:** O(log n) average recursion stack

---

## 5. Merge Sort

Merge Sort follows the **Divide and Conquer** approach. It divides the array into smaller parts, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

### Example

```text
Unsorted Array: 64 25 12 22 11
Sorted Array:   11 12 22 25 64
```

### Complexity

| Case         | Time Complexity |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Best Case    | O(n log n)      |
| Average Case | O(n log n)      |
| Worst Case   | O(n log n)      |

**Space Complexity:** O(n)

## 📊 Comparison of Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case | Space     |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)      |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)      |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)      |
| Quick Sort     | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n²)      | O(log n)* |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)      |

`*` Quick Sort space complexity depends on the implementation and recursion depth.
